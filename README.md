## X Education - Lead Scoring Model

### Problem Statement

X Education is an education company specializing in online courses for industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit their website to explore available courses. These website visitors are categorized as leads when they fill out forms expressing their interest. Subsequently, the company's sales team engages with these leads through calls, emails, and other communication methods. However, the lead conversion rate at X Education is currently at 30%, meaning that out of 100 acquired leads, only around 30 get converted into paying customers.

To improve this process, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, often referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing their efforts on these high-potential leads, the company believes they can increase their lead conversion rate.

### Business Objective

X Education's primary business objective is to develop a lead scoring model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. This scoring system will help the company identify Hot Leads effectively. The CEO's ultimate goal is to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. The company expects the model to be capable of adapting to future constraints, such as peak time actions, optimizing workforce utilization, and defining strategies once the 80% lead conversion target is reached.
